## Code of Conduct

By participating and contributing to this project, you agree to uphold these rules:

- Give credit where credit is due
- Be respectful to all project participants
- Follow the `Code of Conduct` from [contributor-covenant.org](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct/)


### Issues

**Purpose**:
- Documenting critical issues, bugs, and other concerns
- Tracking topics/ questions that need to be researched
- For proposing new features, suggestions, or enhancements

### Pull Requests (PR)

**Guidelines**
- PRs must be associated with an issue
- PRs should only address ONE project related concern
- If PR is rejected, code reviewer must provide reason for rejection
- PRs must be reviewed and tested* (*unless the code is small enough to not require testing*)
  - To test the code, code reviewer must pull the PR, run/test the application, and run unit tests (if any)
- Code reviewer should not do any fixes to the PR before letting the PR author do it themselves

### Git Workflow
- Pick an issue from git issues
- Create branch in local repository
  - Branch naming convention: `<issue-number>-<short issue descriptor>`
    - Ex: For git issue `#4 Create contributing.md document`, branch name can look like: `4-add-contributing-doc`
- Work on issue and make regular commits with good commit messages (see commit message guidelines - [link](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/))
- When ready, push branch to github
- When ready, create pull request; make sure to link the issue in your PR
- Once PR is merged, branch will be deleted
