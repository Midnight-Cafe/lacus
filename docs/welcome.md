Every week we meet to talk about anything related to software development. This
is where we present updates in the community, and is also a place to share and
showcase personal programming-related updates to others in the community. Feel
free to sit in a couple sessions to get a feel for it, there is no pressure to
share anything but you are more than welcome to do so!

**Community Projects**
Here at The Midnight Café we work on various projects. Check out the different
ongoing projects under the _Community Projects_ category. If you are interested
in contributing to any of them go to #roles and assign yourself the appropriate
role.
